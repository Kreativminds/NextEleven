# NextEleven — Bug Queue

How this works:
- Add a new entry under "Open" whenever something is broken, with as much detail as you have (screen, what you tapped, what you expected, what happened).
- The scheduled bug-fix task processes every `Status: Open` entry, fixes what it safely can, and moves each one to "Resolved" with the commit hash — or leaves it Open with a `Needs clarification:` note if it genuinely can't tell what's wrong.
- You can also hand any entry here straight to Claude in a chat to get it fixed immediately instead of waiting for the scheduled run.

(none right now)

## Resolved

<!-- Example format once entries start moving here:
### Captain button does nothing when tapped
- Reported: 2026-10-11
- Status: Fixed (commit b0b4c15)
- Fix: added Toast confirmation + debug logging; enlarged/redesigned the button.
